#Fraud Detection Case Study â€“ Credit Card Transactions
##Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design a predictive model that detects fraudulent credit card transactions, moving from a reactive to a proactive fraud detection strategy.

Fraud is rare (<1.2% of all transactions) but costly. Our analysis shows it is not random: it clusters around specific merchants, categories, and higher transaction amounts.

###Key Result:
The models can detect up to 98% of fraud cases, representing ~$13.9M/month in prevented fraud losses.

##Objectives

Analyze a dataset of ~595K credit card transactions.

Understand fraud distribution and patterns through EDA.

Build multiple ML models to classify fraud vs. non-fraud.

Compare performance with metrics suited for imbalance (Recall, Precision, F1, ROC-AUC).

Translate results into business impact (ROI).
